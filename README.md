### About this Project 
This project was created as a final assignment for the [NOVI Hogeschool bootcamp for Full Stack Developer] (https://www.novi.nl/full-stack-developer/)- Frontend course. I created a virtual bookshelf which allows users to search for and store books to their private bookshelf using the [Open Library API] (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) and the NOVI Educational Backend (https://novi.datavortex.nl). 
Users can: 

* Create a user account by registering and logging in
* See their user account and change their password (looged in users only)
* login and logout
* view a display of 25 random books each time they log in
* search for books based on selections criteria such as: title, subject, keyword, author and exluding author
* view additional information about any book including: tile, author, date of publication, language, page count, subjects and description 
* search for authors by name and view additional information about an author including: photo, bographical information and a selected list of published works
* save any book of interest to their virtual bookshelf
* remove any book from their virtual bookshelf
